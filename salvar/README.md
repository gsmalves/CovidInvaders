# Covid invaders
Covid invaders is a variation of the popular arcade game Space invaders implemented using the pygame library.

Covid invaders is a shooting game where a syringe (player) is used to shoot vaccine shots to destroy the viruses (enemy). The player can only move horizontally while the enemy moves horizontally and vertically, approaching the ground. The enemy also shoots lasers to overcome the syringe. There are various 'variants' of viruses in the game. The player earns points depending on which variant they destroy. The game ends when the player defeats all the viruses or the enemy reaches the ground.
